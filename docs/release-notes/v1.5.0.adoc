.Changes
*The *icellmobilsoft/builder-nexus-download* builder image:
** In the `sonatype-download.sh` script, the default value of the SONATYPE_REPOSITORY environment variable has been changed to `public`, allowing the Sonatype API to also find `-SNAPSHOT` versions.
** A new `DEBUG` variable has been added. In case of `true` it prints the issued commands to the terminal for easy debugging.
